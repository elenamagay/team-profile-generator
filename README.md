## Description
My task for this project was  to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in an information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Also I needed to write a unit test for every part of my code and ensure that it passes each test.


## Installation
```
npm init --yes
npm i inquirer
npm i jest
```


## Usage
The application can be invoked from the command line by running
 ```
 node index
 ```
 Then answer all the questions. After all a new index.html file is created and saved in the current folder.
